# PET-Calculation
This code calculates Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) using the FAO Penman-Monteith method with ERA5 daily climate data over Pakistan for the year 2023. It processes temperature, wind, pressure, and radiation data to compute daily PET, then aggregates it to an annual mean. The results are visualized on a map with a color-coded legend indicating PET values in mm/day. The map centers on Pakistan, providing an overview of regional evapotranspiration patterns. One can chage the region of interest and data source which is freely available in GEE

Best of luck
